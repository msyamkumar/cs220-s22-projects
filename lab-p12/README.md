* Use HTTP requests to download content from the internet
* Cache data onto your computer
* Construct and modify DataFrames to analyze datasets
* Use BeautifulSoup to parse web pages and extract useful information

## Segment 0: Setup

Create a `lab12` directory and download the `practice.ipynb` file into the directory.

## Segments 1-4: Web Requests, Caching, DataFrames and Scraping
For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb` and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

## Project Instructions

* Copy the `download` and `parse_html` functions over to your project notebook.
