## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab11` directory and download the following files into the `lab11` directory.

* `data.zip`
* `practice.ipynb`

After downloading data.zip, make sure to extract it (using [Mac directions](http://osxdaily.com/2017/11/05/how-open-zip-file-mac/) or [Windows directions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028088/windows-zip-and-unzip-files)). After extracting, you should see a folder called data, which has the following files in it:

* .channel_ids0.json
* .hidden.txt
* channel_ids1.json
* channel_ids2.json
* channel_ids3.json
* channel_ids4.json
* channel_ids5.json
* comment_data1.csv
* comment_data2.csv
* comment_data3.csv
* comment_data4.csv
* comment_data5.csv
* video_data.csv
* video_data_shuffled.csv
* video_ids.json

You may delete `data.zip` after extracting these files from it.

## Segments 1-3: 
For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb`, and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

Good luck on p11! We encourage you to stay in lab and ask the TA and Peer Mentor questions.
