# Lab 7: Dictionaries

# WARNING: Unless you took a time portal to become my student in the past, this is not the correct repository :) Please go to the correct github repository for the current semester. If you are a Spring'22 semester student though, you are in the right place.

In this lab, you will analyze recent COVID vaccination data using dictionaries. You will also handle missing data and other issues that arise when dealing with real world datasets.

## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will practice how to...
* Access and utilize data in CSV files
* Deal with messy real-world datasets
* Use dictionaries to organize data into key, value pairs

------------------------------
## Note on Academic Misconduct

You may do these lab exercises with only with your project partner; you are not allowed to start working on lab-p7 with one person, then do the project with a different partner.  Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://www.msyamkumar.com/cs220/s22/syllabus.html).

------------------------------

## Project partner

We strongly recommend students to find a project partner. If you are still looking for a project partner, take a moment now to ask around the room if anyone would like to partner with you on this project. Then you can work with them on this lab as well as the project.

------------------------------
## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab7` directory and download the following files into the `lab7` directory.

* `vaccinations.csv`
* `practice.ipynb`

If you found your `.csv` file is downloaded as a `.txt` file (e.g. `vaccinations.txt` instead of `vaccinations.csv`), run `mv vaccinations.txt vaccinations.csv` from your Powershell/Terminal to change the extension of the file into `.csv` file manually. All the data that we need for p7 is stored in `vaccinations.csv`

To start, familiarize yourself with the dataset (`vaccinations.csv`). Examine its contents using Microsoft Excel, Numbers (Mac) or any other spreadsheet software.

------------------------------

## Segments 2-4: COVID-19 Vaccinations

For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb`, and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

## Project 7

Hopefully, this lab helped you get familiar with dictionaries! Now you're ready to start p7. If you have time left in lab, go ahead and start p7 now, so you can ask your lab TA questions. Remember to only work with at most one partner on p7 from this point on. Have fun!
