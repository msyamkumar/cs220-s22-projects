    "In this lab, you'll get practice with files and formats, in preparation for p10. If you haven't already done so, make sure to download data.zip from Github and extract it to your lab10 folder. Your lab10 folder should contain the following:\n",

    "## File Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "For p10, you'll need to be familiar with the following file-related terms to know what we're asking you to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with the assignment, let's talk about the distinction between these terms, which will become important as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directory:** a collection of files and directories.  \"Folder\" is a less-technical synonym you've doubtless heard frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File Name:** a name you can use for a file if you know what directory you're in.  For example, `movies.csv`, `test.py`, and `main.ipynb` are examples of file names.  Note that different files can have the same name, as long as those files are in different directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Path:** a more-complete name that tells you the file name AND what directory it is in. For example, `p8/main.ipynb` and `p9/main.ipynb` are examples of path names on a Mac, referring to a file named `main.ipynb` in the p8 directory and a second file with the same name in the p9 directory, respectively. Windows uses back-slashes instead of forward slashes, so on a Windows laptop the paths would be `p8\\main.ipynb` and `p9\\main.ipynb`. There may be more levels in a path to represent more levels of directories. For example, `courses\\cs220\\p8\\test.py` refers to the test.py file in the p8 directory, which is in the cs220 directory, which is in the courses directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Absolute vs Relative Path:** A relative path specifies a location on your computer based on the current working directory (in this case, the folder you ran the jupyter notebook in). On the other hand, an absolute path specifies the location based on the root folder on your computer. As an example of both, the relative path to the `channel_ids1.json` file in the `data` folder would be `data/channel_ids1.json`, but the absolute path would look something like `C:/Users/Tim/Documents/Lab10/data/channel_ids1.json`"
