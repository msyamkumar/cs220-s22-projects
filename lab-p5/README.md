# Lab P5: Looping Patterns and Hurricane API

This lab will introduce you to some fundamental looping patterns that will be helpful in solving p5. It is designed to help you get comfortable with using functions in `project.py` for p5. You will also learn basic methods to manipulate strings that will be helpful in solving p5.

----------------------------------
## Learning Objectives:
In this lab you will practice:
- Inspecting a `project.py` file
- Iterating through the hurricane data using a `for` loop
- Writing algorithms to search, filter, count, and find min / max
- Writing algorithms that use an index: find other data corresponding to min / max
- Writing helper functions
- Using Python's `datetime` module
- Writing algorithms that manipulate strings

## Note on Academic Misconduct

You may do these lab exercises with only with your project partner; you are not allowed to start working on lab5 with one person, then do the project with a different partner.  Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://www.msyamkumar.com/cs220/s22/syllabus.html).

------------------------------
## Project Partner

We strongly recommend students to find a project partner. Pair programming is a great way to learn from a fellow student. Project difficulty level increases exponentially in this course. It is a good idea to find a project partner early on during the semester.

If you are still looking for a project partner, take a moment now to ask around the room if anyone would like to partner with you on this project. Then you can work with them on this lab as well as the project.

----------------------------------
## Segment 1: Setup

Create a `lab5` directory and download the following files into the `lab5` directory:

* `project.py`
* `practice.ipynb`
* `hurricanes.csv`

If you found your `.csv` files are downloaded as `.txt` files (e.g. `hurricanes.txt` instead of `hurricanes.csv`), run `mv hurricanes.txt hurricanes.csv` from your Powershell/Terminal to change the extension of the file into `.csv` file manually. Here `mv` is a shell command to rename or move files.

----------------------------------
## Segments 2 - 5: Hurricanes

Details for Segments 2 - 5 are in the `practice.ipynb` file.

After completing this lab, you will be ready to work on [p5](https://github.com/msyamkumar/cs220-s22-projects/tree/main/p5)! Remember to only work with p5 with your partner from this point on. Have fun!
