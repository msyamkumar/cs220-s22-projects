## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will practice how to...
* Use SQL queries to extract data from a database
* Use different SQL keywords to organize data
* Write different plotting functions to visualize data and engage in data exploration

------------------------------
## Segment 0: Setup

Create a `lab13` directory and download the `practice.ipynb` file into the directory.

------------------------------

## Segments 1-3: SQL Practice

For the remaining segments, detailed instructions are provided in `practice.ipynb`. From the terminal, open a `jupyter notebook` session, open your `practice.ipynb`, and follow the instructions in `practice.ipynb`.

------------------------------

## Project

In the project, you will use the plotting functions from the lab, as well as the different SQL query techniques described in the `practice.ipynb` notebook. Good luck!
